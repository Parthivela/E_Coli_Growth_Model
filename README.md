# E. coli Bacteria Population Growth Model

This project models and visualizes the exponential growth of *E. coli* bacteria using Python.  
It uses the mathematical model \( y = 2^x \), where:
- \( x \) is the time in hours
- \( y \) is the number of bacteria cells at time \( x \)

The program also plots a histogram with relative frequency using **Sturges' Rule** to determine the optimal number of bins.

## üìå Features

- Calculates bacterial population at specific time points
- Uses exponential growth model \( y = 2^x \)
- Applies Sturges' Rule to determine histogram bins
- Plots histogram using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
